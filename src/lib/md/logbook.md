# LogBook

For the next 6 months, I'll be logging my advancements every day in this logbook.  
Its content may be utterly random, but its goal is for me to have a record of my research and for you, readers, to have an insight into what I am working on and any interesting findings I may come upon. Although for now very basic, this logbook will evolve throughout my stay to someday look more decent.

**My subject will be revolving around finding a way to combine multi-source satellite imagery to provide an accurate way to classify tree-specific species (whether in urban areas or high-density forests).**

I have been searching for ground-truth data as per my advisor's feedback.  
I have stumbled upon a few datasets:
- Planted
- Pureforest
- TreeSatAI

I have also been exploring with QGIS, an open-source Geographic Information System (GIS).
Here's a sample of TreeSatAI dataset.

(Yeah I know, it's a mess...)

I have finally settled on a subject after 2 weeks of searching. Today, I just got this website running with very minimal content and styling. The logging will debut tomorrow!  
As for now, here's just a simple website I stumbled upon which has pretty impressive photography: [ESA Earth from space](https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Sets/Earth_from_Space_image_collection/(result_type)/images).
