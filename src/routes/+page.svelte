    <h1>LogBook</h1>
    <p>
    For the next 6 months, i'll be logging my advancements everyday in this logbook.
    Its content may be utterly random, but its goal is for me to have a record of my 
    research and for you, readers, to have an insight on what I am working on and 
    any interesting findings I may come upon. Although for now very basic, this logbook
    will evolve throughout my stay to someday look more decent.

    I have finally settled on a subject after 2 weeks of searching. Today, I just got this 
    website running with very minimal content and styling. The logging will debut tomorrow !
    As for now, here's just a simple website I stumbled upon which has pretty impressive
    photography <a href="https://www.esa.int/ESA_Multimedia/Sets/Earth_from_Space_image_collection/(result_type)/images">ESA Earth from space</a>
